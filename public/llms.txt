# Rodrigo Bermejo

## Who I am
I am a Technical Consultant specializing in Business Process Automation and Operation. I help companies eliminate operational chaos without requiring them to build and maintain their own infrastructure.

## What I do
I design, build, and operate automation systems. My service is a "Managed Service" model:
1. **Setup**: I integrate APIs, datasets, and manual processes into a cohesive system.
2. **Operation**: I run the infrastructure, handle maintenance, and ensure stability.

## Business Model
- **One-time Setup Fee**: For initial analysis and implementation.
- **Monthly Retainer**: For ongoing operation, monitoring, and minor adjustments.

## Topics
- Business Process Automation
- System Integration (APIs, Webhooks)
- Operational Efficiency
- Managed Services
